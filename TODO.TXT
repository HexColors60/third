Things to do on the Third compiler:
-----------------------------------

BUGS
  * LENGTH will include the CR in the line length if you have a string like
    "asdf\0D", ie., with just a CR on the end (if your buffer isn't quite
    big enough for the LF say)
  * READ-LINE can return more than u1 characters (ie., u2>u1) if the line
    is longer than u1+2 chars or if there is an LF at (zero-based) position
    u1+1


TODO
  * memory allocation wordset, maybe when I need them
  * block wordset should be coded, unlikely I ever will... :-)
  * floating wordset, do we need 'em for this small Forth?
  * locals wordset, ditto
  * the programming tools word EDITOR is missing
